Since we're rendering the exact same tree on the server\n * and client, we can increment a counter and get a deterministic result between\n * client and server. Also, JS integers can go up to nine-quadrillion. I'm\n * pretty sure the tab will be closed before an app never needs\n * 10 quadrillion IDs!\n *\n * Problem solved, right?\n *\n * Ah, but there's a catch! React's concurrent rendering makes this approach\n * non-deterministic. While the client and server will end up with the same\n * elements in the end, depending on suspense boundaries (and possibly some user\n * input during the initial render) the incrementing integers won't always match\n * up.\n *\n * Solution 3: Don't use IDs at all on the server; patch after first render.\n *\n * What we've done here is solution 2 with some tricks. With this approach, the\n * ID returned is an empty string on the first render. This way the server and\n * client have the same markup no matter how wild the concurrent rendering may\n * have gotten.\n *\n * After the render, we patch up the components with an incremented ID. This\n * causes a double render on any components with `useId`. Shouldn't be a problem\n * since the components using this hook should be small, and we're only updating\n * the ID attribute on the DOM, nothing big is happening.\n *\n * It doesn't have to be an incremented number, though--we could do generate\n * random strings instead, but incrementing a number is probably the cheapest\n * thing we can do.\n *\n * Additionally, we only do this patchup on the very first client render ever.\n * Any calls to `useId` that happen dynamically in the client will be\n * populated immediately with a value.
