## Volvo Cars UI Design Tokens

> Design tokens capture the low-level design properties like colors, grid, spacing and typography. These tokens provide a single source of truth and feed into the different platform SDKs and UI components. Use this if you're building a new UI framework or SDK from scratch.

All Design tokens in this repository **should be in sync with the design libraries in Figma** (right now there is no automatic sync but the plan in to have a single source of truth).


## Usage

If you are running Node.js you can get the latest design tokens by running `npm install vcc-ui-design-tokens` in your project

### Output structure

The build outputs several formats optimised for different platforms and frameworks.

```
- build/
  - web
    - volvo
      - tokens.css
      - tokens.json
      - tokens.scss
    - volvo-dark
  - android
    - volvo
    - volvo-dark
  - ios
    - volvo
    - volvo-dark
```

## Development


To build the design tokens locally run `yarn build`

To edit the design tokens you need to edit the JSON files inside the `src/` folder

### Source Structure

## Globals

These are design tokens that apply to all platforms and are shared across brands

## Brands

These are brand specif overrides. Right now Volvo Light and Volvo Dark are treated as two different brands, in the future we might extend the design system to include brands like Care By Volvo.

## Platforms

These contain platform specific design tokens. Such as "breakpoints" for web.
