# Grid


The Grid components consists of 3 different components: `<Grid>`, `<Row>`, `<Col>`.
By default, it has a max content width of 1320px and gutters of 24px.

### Example

```jsx
<Grid>
  <Row align="center">
    <Col size={3}>Size: 3</Col>
    <Col size={7}>Size: 7</Col>
  </Row>
  <Row align="flex-start">
    <Col size={2}>Size: 2</Col>
    <Col size={5}>Size: 5</Col>
  </Row>
</Grid>
```

### Props - Grid
Name | Description   | Type  | Default Value  |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
`children` | A JSX node | node | n/a
# Row


A row groups a number of columns and can align them

### Props - Row
Name | Description   | Type  | Default Value  |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
`align` | Align columns | enum('start','end','center') | `'start'`
`children` | A JSX node | node | n/a
# Col


A col component has a size to define how many columns it spans over.

The size prop can be used in two different ways:

- Passing a number will set the column size for the `fromL` breakpoint while it defaults to full width for smaller viewports.
- Passing an object with sizes for the available breakpoints:
  - `default`: refers to viewports from **0 - 480px**
  - `theme.breakpoints.fromM`: refers to viewports from **480 - 1024px**
  - `theme.breakpoints.fromL`: refers to viewports over **1024px**

### Props - Col
Name | Description   | Type  | Default Value  |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
`children` | A JSX node | node | n/a
`size` | Size of column | union(object,number) | `{ default: 4, '@media (min-width: 1024px)': 12 }`
# DebugGrid


We also provide a debugging component that displays a fixed grid overlay. You can use it by importing it in development:

### Example

```jsx
<DebugGrid />
```

### Props - DebugGrid
Name | Description   | Type  | Default Value  |
--- | --- | --- | --- |
`disabled` | Disable debug grid | bool | `false`
`storybook` | Enable if using in a storybook environment | bool | `false`
