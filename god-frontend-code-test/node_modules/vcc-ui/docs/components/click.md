# Click


An unstyled component that can be used for creating your own clickable components. It's basically a native HTML button element with all the browser default styling removed.

If you pass a href, click will render an `<a>`, otherwise it will render as a `<button>`.

### Example

```jsx live=true
<Click
  extend={{ background: "ghostwhite" }}
  onClick={() => {
    alert("hey");
  }}
>
  I'm an unstyled clickable button
</Click>
```
