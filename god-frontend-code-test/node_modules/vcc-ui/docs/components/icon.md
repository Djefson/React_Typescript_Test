# Icon


** WORK IN PROGRESS: ** We are awaiting a refreshed list of icons from our Design Team. The icons currently included are only provisional. A new set of 50+ new icons is expected in our 2.0 release

Icons are used to visually communicate core parts of the product and available actions. They can act as wayfinding tools to help users more easily understand where they are in the product, and common interaction patterns that are available.


### Example
```jsx live=true
<>
	<Icon type="facebook"/>
	<Icon type="twitter" size="m" color="lightblue"/>
	<Icon type="youtube" size="l" color="red"/>
	<Icon type="globe" size="l" color="black"/>
</>
```

### Props - Icon
